Implementing terrain visualization and spatial analysis using the Kokalj et al. (2023) dataset. This project explores the integration of advanced LiDAR processing techniques with modern geoinformation workflows to enhance feature recognition in digital terrain models.

## About the Project
This project is conducted as part of my **Bachelor of Science Thesis** at **Istanbul Technical University (ITU)**, Department of **Geomatics Engineering**.

### Objective
The primary aim is to process and visualize spatial data to identify micro-topographic features. By utilizing the datasets and methodologies proposed by **Kokalj et al. (2023)**, this research compares different visualization techniques (such as Sky-View Factor, Openness, and local relief models) to determine their impact on topographic interpretation.

### Data Source
The experimental data utilized in this study is sourced from the publication: 
*Kokalj, Ž., et al. (2023). [Machine learning-ready remote sensing data for Maya archaeology].*
